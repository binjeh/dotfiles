# Operating System Configuration Scripts

These scripts install and/or configure package managers and install software
that I use on that operating system.

## Linux

Linux configuration and install scripts are separated by distro.


## Windows

Windows installers are broken up into groups due to having to configure parts
of windows as well as installing the package manager.

Windows installation scripts also automatically elevate to admin privileges
where needed and will open in new sessions of the correct powershell version
needed for runtime.
