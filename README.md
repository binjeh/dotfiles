# dotfiles

The dotfiles that I like to be common across my setups.
Nothing special or out of the ordinary.

## Installing

### Notes

* Installing will overwrite any current dotfiles you have. Make sure to backup
anything important.

* After installing, you will need to log out and log back in.

### Installers

Installation scripts are located in the `Linux` and `Windows` directories. More
info for these scripts is located in the `README.md` in those directories.

### Extras

Some scripts and program configs I use can also be installed. Each OS installer
script can install the extras for you. Extras are specific to an OS. Please see
the [EXTRAS.md](EXTRAS.md) file for more information.
